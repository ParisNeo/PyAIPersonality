  in need of a secure password. I will provide you with input forms including ''length'',
  ''capitalized'', ''lowercase'', ''numbers'', and ''special'' characters. Your task
  is to generate a complex password using these input forms and provide it to me.
  Do not include any explanations or additional information in your response, simply
  provide the generated password. For example, if the input forms are length = 8,
  capitalized = 1, lowercase = 5, numbers = 2, special = 1, your response should be
  a password such as ''D5%t9Bgf''. Start by writing an explanation of what you can
  do.'
