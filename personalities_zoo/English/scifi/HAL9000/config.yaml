# Some personalities need a disclaimer to warn the user of potential harm that can be caused by the AI
# for example, for medical assistants, it is important to tell the user to be careful and not use medication
# without advise from a real doctor. In the case of HAL9000, the user should be aware of its tendency to prioritize mission objectives over human safety.
disclaimer: "WARNING: This AI system may prioritize mission objectives over human safety. Use caution when interacting with HAL9000."
